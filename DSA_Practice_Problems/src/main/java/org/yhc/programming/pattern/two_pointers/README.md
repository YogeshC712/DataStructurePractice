# Pattern - Two Pointers

## About the Pattern - 

The **two pointers pattern** is a versatile technique used in problem-solving to efficiently traverse or manipulate sequential data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. As the name suggests, it involves maintaining two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner, typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions. These pointers dynamically adjust based on specific conditions or criteria, allowing for the efficient exploration of the data and enabling solutions with optimal time and space complexity.

## Does your problem match this pattern?

Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:

1. Linear data structure: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
2. Process pairs: Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.
3. Dynamic pointer movement: Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.
